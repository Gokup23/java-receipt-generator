# Simple Receipt Generator ðŸ§¾

A simple command-line application written in Java that generates a sales receipt. This project was created as a practice exercise to strengthen fundamental Java programming skills. It takes user input for an item's name, quantity, and price, then calculates the subtotal, tax, and final total, presenting it all in a nicely formatted receipt.

## Features
* Accepts user input for item details (name, quantity, price).
* Accurately calculates subtotal, a fixed tax amount, and the final total.
* Uses the `BigDecimal` class to handle monetary values, avoiding floating-point inaccuracies.
* Displays a clean, aligned, and easy-to-read receipt in the console.

## Technologies Used
* **Java**: Core programming language.
* **Java Development Kit (JDK)**: To compile and run the application.
